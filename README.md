4.1 Built in subprograms

## Part 1: Math
### Create a program that:
1. Let's the user decide what they are going to do (option a or b)
2. option a, calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle given the two other sides (a squared plus b squared = c squared)
3. Option b, calculate the circumference of a circle given the radius

## Part 2: String
### Create another program within the same repository that:
1. Let's the user search a string for a word (first word entered)
2. replaces said word with another that they enter (second word entered) if it's in the string
3. Replaces the string variable with the new string containing the new word (second one entered)
4. Outputs the new updated string

Hint: You will need to know the length of the words entered

#### The string you'll be using are here: (leave the '\n's)
Space, the final frontier \n
These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise \n
Its five year mission \n
To explore strange new worlds \n
To seek out new life \n
And new civilizations \n
To boldly go where no man has gone before \n
